  <p class="note"><span class="important">IMPORTANT</span>Â Care must be taken when drawing surfaces or textures to a view with a surface assigned to it, because if you try to draw the view&#39;s assigned surface (or its texture) inside that same view, you will get an error as you are essentially trying to draw a texture onto itself.</p>
