  This function must be called before you can define any primitives. There are 6 types of primitives you can define as the following constants:
  
    
      
      
    
    
      
        Primitive Type Constant
      
      
        Constant
        Description
      
      
        pr_pointlist
        A point list
      
      
        pr_linelist
        A line list
      
      
        pr_linestrip
        A line strip
      
      
        pr_trianglelist
        A triangle list
      
      
        pr_trianglestrip
        A triangle strip
      
      
        pr_trianglefan
        A triangle fan
      
    
  
   
  The following image illustrates basically how these should look and also the order in which you should define the vertexes:
  Please note that on some platforms (Windows, UWP, XBox) the pr_trianglefan type is not natively supported and so GameMaker Studio 2 does a conversion when the game is compiled to make them work. This means that on those platforms the pr_trianglefan type will be much slower to use than the others. This Also note that to use this function on HTML5, you must enable WebGL in the Game Options.
   
  Syntax:
  draw_primitive_begin(kind)
  
    
      
        Argument
        Type
        Description
      
      
        kind
        Primitive Type Constant
        The kind of primitive you are going to draw.
      
    
  
   
  Returns:
  N/A
   
  Example:
  var _steps = 20;
    var _xx = 50;
    var _yy = 50;
    var _radius = 30;
    draw_primitive_begin(pr_trianglefan);
    draw_vertex(_xx, _yy);
    for(var i = 0; i <= _steps; ++i;)
    {
        draw_vertex(_xx + lengthdir_x(_radius, 270 * i / _steps), _yy + lengthdir_y(_radius, 270 * i / _steps));
    }
    draw_primitive_end();
  The above code will draw three quarters of a circle made from primitives.
