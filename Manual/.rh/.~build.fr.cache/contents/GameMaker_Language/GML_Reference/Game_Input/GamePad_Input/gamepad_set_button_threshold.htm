  
  gamepad_set_button_threshold
  This function can be used to set the current threshold setting of the analogue buttons for a given device. The default threshold for all analogue buttons is 0.5, with the range being from 0 to 1.
  The threshold defines at what point the button is considered as being "pressed" for games that require them to act as a digital button.
  This function will affect the check, pressed and released states for analogue buttons, but will not affect the value returned by the function gamepad_button_value(), which will always return the raw value for the button.
   
  Syntax:
  gamepad_set_button_threshold(device, threshold);
  
    
      
        Argument
        Type
        Description
      
      
        device
        Real
        Which gamepad device "slot" to check.
      
      
        threshold
        Real
        The new threshold value (from 0 - 1, default 0.5).
      
    
  
   
  Returns:
  N/A
   
  Example:
  if gamepad_get_button_threshold(0) != 0.5
    {
        gamepad_set_button_threshold(0, 0.5);
    }
  The above code checks the analogue button threshold of the gamepad connected to device "slot" 0 and if it is not the default value of 0.5, it is set to that value.
