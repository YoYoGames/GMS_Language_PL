  WARNING! This function is deprecated (and replaced by array_length()) as arrays are no longer limited to only 1 or 2 dimensions, and as such this function is only supplied for support of legacy projects. All new projects should use the current way of creating and accessing multi-dimension arrays (see here for more information).
  With this function you can get the length (number of entries) of a 1D array. For 2D arrays you should be using the array_height_2d and array_length_2d functions.
  IMPORTANT!: If the array has over 32,000 entries this function will return an erroneous value and should not be used.
   
  Syntax:
  array_length_1d(array_index);
  
    
      
        Argument
        Type
        Description
      
      
        array_index
        Array
        The index of the array to check.
      
    
  
   
  Returns:
  Real
   
  Example:
  for (var i = array_length_1d(a) - 1; i > -1; i--;)
    {
        a[i] = -1;
    }
  The above code will loop through an array and set each entry to -1.
