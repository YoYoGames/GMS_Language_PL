  This function will return a struct containing all the data for the given animation curve. You supply the animation curve asset ID (as defined in the Asset Browser), and the function will return a struct with the following variables:
  
    
      
      
      
    
    
      
        Animation Curve Struct
      
      
        Variable Name
        Data Type
        Description
      
      
        name
        string
        This is the name of the animation curve.
      
      
        channels
        array pointer
        This is an array, where each item in the array is a channel struct.
      
    
  
  
    The channels variable in the struct is an array where each array item is an Animation Curve Channel Struct with data relating to a channel within the curve. The channel struct is explained on this page.
  As with channels, the points on a single channel are stored as structs in an array, where each item in the array is a single point struct. The point struct is explained on this page.
  Note that if the function fails (e.g. the given Animation Curve asset does not exist) then the function will return -1.
   
  Syntax:
  animcurve_get(curve_id);
  
    
      
        Argument
        Type
        Description
      
      
        curve_id
        Animation Curve Asset
        The asset browser ID (index) of the animation curve to get.
      
    
  
   
  Returns:
  Animation Curve Struct or -1
   
  Example:
  var _curve = animcurve_get(ac_ButtonTween);
    var _channel = _curve.channels[0];
    if _channel.type != animcurvetype_linear
    {
        _channel.type = animcurvetype_linear;
    }
  The above code retrieves the animation curve struct for the curve asset "ac_ButtonTween", then checks the curve type for the first channel, and if it's not linear it sets it to linear.
