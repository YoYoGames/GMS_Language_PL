  This function can be used to get the value at a specific point in time from a channel struct. You supply the struct pointer for the channel (as returned by the function animcurve_get_channel(), or as returned in the animation curve struct from the function animcurve_get()) and the "x" (time) position along the curve channel to evaluate. This position should be between 0 and 1, and the function will return the curve value at that position, or it will return 0 if the channel struct supplied is invalid.
   
   
  Syntax:
  animcurve_channel_evaluate(channel_struct, posx);
  
    
      
        Argument

        Description
      
      
        channel_struct
        Animation Curve Channel Struct
        The struct pointer for the channel to evaluate.
      
      
        posx
        Real
        The position in time to check (from 0 to 1).
      
    
  
   
  Returns:
  Real
   
  Example:
  var _channel = animcurve_get_channel(ac_AlphaCurve, 0);
    var _val = animcurve_channel_evaluate(_channel, sin(current_time/1000));
    image_alpha = _val;
  The above code gets the channel struct for the animation curve asset "ac_AlphaCurve". It then uses the returned evaluation value to set the image alpha for the instance.
