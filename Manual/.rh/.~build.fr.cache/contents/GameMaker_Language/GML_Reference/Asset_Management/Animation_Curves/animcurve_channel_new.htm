  This function can be used to create a new animation curve channel struct. A channel struct has the following variables:
  
    
      
      
      
    
    
      
        Animation Curve Channel Struct
      
      
        Variable Name
        Data Type
        Description
      
      
        name
        string
        This is the name of the channel.
      
      
        type
        Animation Curve Interpolation Type Constant
        This will be one of the constants given in the table below.
      
      
        iterations
        integer
        If the channel is using catmull-rom ("smooth") interpolation this holds how many points have been generated for each segment of the curve (note that these extra points are internal to the function and only used for the runtime calculations). If the channel is using linear interpolation, this value will still exist but can be ignored as it has no bearing on how the curve is interpolated.
      
      
        points
        array
        This is an array, where each item in the array is an Animation Curve Point Struct.
      
    
  
   
  
    
      
      
    
    
      
        Animation Curve Interpolation Type Constant
      
      
        Constant
        Description
      
      
        animcurvetype_linear
        Used for linear interpolation between points.
      
      
        animcurvetype_catmullrom
        Used for smooth interpolation between points using catmull-rom interpolation.
      
    
  
  
    By default when you create a new channel struct, the "name" variable will be an empty string, the "type" will be animcurvetype_linear and the "iterations" will be 16. All these variables can be set to the values that you require (note that the "iterations" value has no effect on linear curve types). Once created you need to add points to the curve, which is done by adding different point structs to the "points" array. These point structs can be created using the function animcurve_point_new().
   
  Syntax:
  animcurve_channel_new();
   
  Returns:
  Animation Curve Channel Struct
   
  Example:
  my_curve = animcurve_create();
    my_curve.name = "My_Curve";
    var _channels = array_create(1);
    _channels[0] = animcurve_channel_new();
    _channels[0].name = "alpha";
    _channels[0].type = animcurvetype_catmullrom;
    _channels[0].iterations = 8;
    var _points = array_create(3);
    _points[0] = animcurve_point_new();
    _points[0].posx = 0;
    _points[0].value = 0;
    _points[1] = animcurve_point_new();
    _points[1].posx = 0.5;
    _points[1].value = 1;
    _points[2] = animcurve_point_new();
    _points[2].posx = 1;
    _points[2].value = 0;
    _channels[0].points = _points;
    my_curve.channels = _channels;
  The above code creates a new animation curve struct and stores it in the variable "my_curve". This struct is then populated with a name and a channel array. The channel array contains a single channel with three points.
