  time_source_start
  This function starts the given Time Source, changing its state to time_source_state_active.
  The specified Time Source may be a new Time Source that was never started, was paused, stopped or expired with no repetitions.
  This function will "soft-reset" the given Time Source, resetting its expiry time and reps remaining to the values that were configured for it.
   
  Syntax:
  time_source_start(id);
  
    
      
      
      
    
    
      
        Argument
        Type
        Description
      
      
        id
        Time Source ID
        The Time Source to start
      
    
  
   
  Returns:
  N/A
   
  Example:
  var _my_method = function()
    {
        instance_destroy();
    }
    
    var _time_source = time_source_create(time_source_game, 300, time_source_units_frames, _my_method);
    
    time_source_start(_time_source);
  
  In this example, we want the instance to destroy itself 300 frames later.
  The code first creates a method that simply calls instance_destroy().
  It then creates a Time Source, inheriting from the Game Time Source. It sets its period to 300 frames.
  Finally, it starts the Time Source.
