  A DS priority queue is a special data structure similar to a DS queue, only here the queue of values is ordered by the priorities (always real numbers) that the values have been assigned. This structure can be very useful for constructing leaderboards or information lists where the importance of each entry can be weighted.
  NOTE: As with all dynamic resources, data structures take up memory and so should always be destroyed when no longer needed to prevent memory leaks which will slow down and eventually crash your game.
  NOTE: If you need to check if a data structure exists, you can use the ds_exists() function.
  The following functions exist that deal with DS priority queues:
  
    ds_priority_create
    ds_priority_destroy
    ds_priority_clear
    ds_priority_empty
    ds_priority_size
    ds_priority_add
    ds_priority_change_priority
    ds_priority_delete_max
    ds_priority_delete_min
    ds_priority_delete_value
    ds_priority_find_max
    ds_priority_find_min
    ds_priority_find_priority
    ds_priority_copy
    ds_priority_read
    ds_priority_write
